# rock-paper-scissors

First entry: This is my first JS project.

Second entry: I am revisiting my 'Rock Paper Scissors' project and adding an UI to it. I am also learning how to set up a new branch on my previous Rock Paper Scissors repo.

Third entry: I refactored (reworked/rewrote) my original code to make it work for the new UI and the added DOM methods.
